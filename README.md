Semantic-Relationship
=====================

Study and Analysis of semantic relationship between words in the documents. 

Go to /src folder for source code. I still need to exhaust the frequency matrix and create pattern string. 

But since the codebase is so FUNCTIONAL, so its just calling of functions. 

The /main folder contains the classes for different functionalities while the /tests folder has the driver programs 
for the classes. 

NOTE : Entire codebase is developed on the IDE named IntelliJ IDEA.( https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ ). 
Directly copying the source into ECLIPSE and NetBeans won't get the things up and running.

Happy Coding ;)
